OVERALL EXPLANATION
1. tree
2. string figure (skipped)
3. blob
4. packed square that tracks vertices
5. the square and vertices on the edge, but with the square packing

1. The tree is input numerically by writing out a list of lists. rivers are integers
    on their own, are not in a list (kinda. it's complicated)
2. skip straight to 3
3. the blob figure is made by blobify(tree) and caluclates the distances between the
    tips of branches as paths along the tree. It is circular, so to speak.
4. The minimum grid size is calculated based off the blob figure. The program
    tries to inscribe a square of the given grid size into the blob figure.
    If it doesn't work, the program increases the grid size and tries again. There
    may be multiple solutions.
5. the vertices are marked based on the packing along the 4 sides, then a square and
    ridge creases are drawn around the vertex with "radius" being the flap length for
    that vertex. If there are wasted edges, the flaps on that edge might be able to shift.


STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE
=========
show multiple solutions: open a new canvas, but all of them called canvas. etc need the name of the new canvas.
    that or have a button to switch between them. canvas.update() and clear the thing
better blobifier. is locations necessary though? (actually, probably yeah for blob to work)
fix the situations that print "this might get weird". example: treepacking([[1,1],2,[3,1]]). This one has empty lists
fix overlapping squares. ex [[4, 6, 1], 1, [3, 4], 3, [6]]
